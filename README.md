# Quantum-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Another Leap  experiment. QRock,  QPaper,  QScissors 
Noticing I get a different but correct answer each time I ran a Leap Program I wondered where I could use this. And they seem to be random.  Sounds like that game -   Rock Paper Scissors.

That would be 4 nodes with all 3 vertices as constraints. hmm  To play you thow down your offer with one hand and  and hit the green arrow to run the program with the other. The constraint pairs would  just be: (1,2)  (2,3) ( 3,1)  and a (4,4)  The last one is to let Q know there are 4 nodes not just 3. 

In a square there are 6 verts and I constrained 3 so sb 3 back. I'll try a little recoding the answer per the social networks example line "nx.relabel_nodes(G,{0: Alice,1:Bob - -  " and I should get the words instead if just numerical.  It will be interesting to see if it  favors 1 or is truely random.  and they say theres no useful apps for Quantum computers!


Yup it worked!! Pics of successive runs included and run times.
